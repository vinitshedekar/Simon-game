## Technologies Used

- **CSS3**: Styling for the game layout and animations.

- **jQuery**: For handling DOM manipulation and game sequences.
- **Responsive Web Design**: Optimized for mobile and desktop.

## How to Play

1. Press the **Start** button to begin the game.
2. Watch the pattern of lights and sounds.
3. Repeat the pattern by clicking the colors in the correct order.
4. As you progress, the sequence will get longer.
